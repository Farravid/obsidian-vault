# Intel x86

## 32 bits

### Calling convention

> [!NOTE] Info
> The calling convention is only useful if you are planning to use the objects `.o` generated from your assembly code with other objects generated by a C/C++ compiler since these follow this calling convection for passing parameters and functions.

TODO

```python
main:
	push ebp
	mov  ebp, esp
	# code that will modify esp
	
	mov  esp, ebp
	pop  ebp
```
