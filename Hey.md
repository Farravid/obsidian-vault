Hey Nadja! I hope you are doing good. 

Just wanted to reach out to you in case you have some remote C++ job available! After spending a bit of time working as animation programmer with Unreal I found that my real passion is pure C++.

So ideally I'd be looking for something C++ specific, modern C++ (17/20), with some house engine instead of Unreal where I can use and learn STL C++. We can call it engine programmer

Let me know if you have something interesting! Thanks you and have a nice day!

Best,
David
