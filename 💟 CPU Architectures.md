# 64 bits vs 32 bits

These are some of the advantages that 64 bits systems have over 32 bits ones
-  Functions parameters are transferred in registers rather tan on the stack
-  The allocation and deallocation of big memory blocks is more efficient.
-  The SSE2 instruction set is supported on all 64-bit CPUs and operating systems.
